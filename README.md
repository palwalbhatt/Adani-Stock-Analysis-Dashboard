 Power BI can be used to analyze stock data to help businesses make informed investment 
decisions. It can help businesses identify trends and insights in stock market data by 
consolidating data from various sources, such as market data feeds, trading platforms, financial 
news sources, and internal trading systems. Power BI can then use this data to create dashboards 
that incorporate visualization techniques like charts, graphs, and tables to provide a clear 
overview of the data. Businesses can customize the dashboards to focus on the metrics that are 
most relevant to them.
